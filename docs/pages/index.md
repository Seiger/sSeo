# Welcome to Tailwind Jekyll!

This is a [starter template](https://vsoch.github.com/tw-jekyll/) for a Tailwind jekyll theme, based
on [these docs](https://github.com/superfly/docs) that are based on [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation),
however everything has been modified to work on GitHub pages (using Jekyll). If you don't need
native deployment on GitHub pages, then please consider checking out Tailwind. 
The original [Apache License](https://github.com/vsoch/tw-jekyll/tree/main/LICENSE) is included.

## Purpose

GitHub pages uses Jekyll natively, so when I make documentation, I typically
look for Jekyll templates. Why? Using Jekyll means that I can use markdown,
and allow for users to easily contribute, and build automatically just by
way of pushing to a main branch (or general GitHub pages).

For getting started with development, see the {% include doc.html name="Getting Started" path="getting-started" %} page. Would you like to request a feature or contribute? [Open an issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues)
